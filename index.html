<h1>Welcome to Visualizations of Earthquakes and Volcanoes</h1>

<p> Raluca Nicola created a visualization for <a href="https://ralucanicola.github.io/earthquakes-viz/">earthquakes</a> which creates a 3 dimensional map of earthquakes on Earth's globe. It can be manipulated to visualize sections of the Earth.</p>

      <div id="legend">
        Earthquakes are marked by yellow or green spheres, volcanoes are marked by red spheres at the surface. In this visualization, small yellow
        spheres
        are earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 7 depending on the visualization and the number of earthquakes. Larger red spheres are earthquakes greater than 7 magnitude or 
     are the volcanoes on the surface. Depending on the individual visualization, the color and size of spheres are interpolated. 
        Earthquake depth is exaggerated by a factor of 6. The orange lines represent the boundaries of the tectonic plates. Earthquake data from
        <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">USGS</a>.
