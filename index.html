<h2>Welcome to Visualization of Earthquakes and Volcanoes</h2>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p> Raluca Nicola created a visualization for <a href="https://ralucanicola.github.io/earthquakes-viz/">earthquakes</a> which creates a 3 dimensional map of earthquakes on Earth's globe. It can be manipulated to visualize sections of the Earth.</p>
<div id="details">
      <div id="legend">
        Magnitude 5 earthquakes deeper than 50km with Volcanoes marked. The volcanoes are darker red spheres at the surface. In this visualization, small yellow
        spheres (
        <div class="small-circle"></div>
        ) are earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.5 and 5. Large red spheres (
        <div class="big-circle"></div>
        ) are the volcanoes on the surface. In between, the color and size of spheres are interpolated.
        Earthquake depth is exaggerated by a factor of 6. The orange lines (
        <div class="orange-line"></div>
        ) represent the boundaries of the tectonic plates. Earthquake data from
        <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/">USGS</a>.
